<p>The above code will install fcron and setup a job to run obnam once a day. Since systemd is used on nixos it would be better

obnam.</p>

<p>I have decided to switch from gentoo to nixos. I tried nixos over a year ago but had a lot of troubles. This was
probably because I used the unstable release and couldn&#8217;t really get gradle stuff to work. This time I will only use
the stable release and try to import newer stuff from unstable if I decided I need it. Hopefully I will not have as
many problems as I did with the unstable release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, I downloaded the latest minimal install cd.</p>

<p>Second, I backed up my stuff.</p>

<pre>rsync -r /home/john /mnt/backup</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The biggest worry I had with this install was getting the partitions and boot setup. A few years ago I had to replace
my motherboard because installing the uefi boot loader completely messed up the whole machine. I also considered using
zfs but I&#8217;m not sure I want to dive into that technology yet. So I decided to reuse the setup I used for gentoo. This
helped save time and gave me less to worry about during the whole process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partition setup is somewhat unique and I was able to piece it together by reading about setting up mdadm,
luks, and lvm with gentoo and arch. The partitions look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>partitions:

/dev/sda
|----/dev/sda1----|------------/dev/sda2------------|

/dev/sdb
|----/dev/sdb1----|------------/dev/sdb2------------|</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The the first partitions of each drive are setup by mdadm as a raid1. The second partitions are setup by mdadm as a
raid0. This is the logical view of the raid arrays.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>raid arrays:

|----/dev/md/0----|------------/dev/md/1------------|</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>/dev/md/0 is setup with ext4 and it becomes /boot in the filesystem. /dev/md/1 is slightly more complicated. It is a
luks encrypted drive which contains lvm&#8217;s volume group 0. vg0 contains swap and '/'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know there is a lot more risk with raid0 but I also have a third drive which is used for backups using obnam. This
mitigates any real risks of losing data.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>backup partition:

/dev/sdc
|------------/dev/sdc1------------|</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I read a few posts on reddit where the users coppied the current '/' to a different directory before starting the
install. I decided to try this out since it would make recovering my home directory very easy. The gentoo root was
moved to /gentoo-root. This ended up helping a lot when I needed to setup the mdadm.conf. I just copied most of the
content from the gentoo-root.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting nixos to use the gentoo setup went smoothly. Here is the grub setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-nix" data-lang="nix">boot.loader.grub.enable = true;
boot.loader.grub.version = 2;
boot.loader.grub.devices = [ "/dev/sda" "/dev/sdb" ];</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Grub needs to be installed on both drives (/dev/sda and /dev/sdb) so that if either goes down it will still boot (not
sure this would really work given the raid0). Nixos can open the luks encrypted drive by setting up
<code>boot.initrd.luks.devices</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-nix" data-lang="nix">boot.initrd.luks.devices = [
  {
    name = "root";
    device = "/dev/md/1";
    preLVM = true;
  }
];</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This sets up initrd to open the luks device before searching for lvm volumes. If this doesn&#8217;t happen before the lvm
scan the boot will fail to find swap and '/'. The concept for this setup is 'lvm on luks'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember how my machine has two raid arrays? An interesting thing happens when you have two raid arrays. On each boot
which one gets named /dev/md126 is non-deterministic. As a corollary which one gets named /dev/md127 is
non-deterministic. It is impossible to determine which array contains the luks device ahead of time using these names.
I found that sometimes the boot would ask for the passphrase and sometimes it would not be able to start at all. The
solution is to setup named devices in mdadm.conf and use the correct name in the luks config above. Luckily nixos
supports mdadm.conf within initrd.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-nix" data-lang="nix">boot.initrd.mdadmConf = ''
  DEVICE /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
  DEVICE /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2
  ARRAY /dev/md/0 metadata=1.2 UUID=2a7ffaec:fd80f34a:48cebc26:5caf521c name=g1:0
  ARRAY /dev/md/1 metadata=1.2 UUID=70e06d78:4e14590a:a4e13279:9e6e387f name=g1:1
'';</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This added the names /dev/md/0 and /dev/md/1 which should be used at boot instead of /dev/md126 and /dev/md127. This
solved all the problems with initrd finding the luks device at boot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting this right was a real pain. I&#8217;m not going to say nixos makes it easier because I learned a lot going through
this with gentoo. I believe the gentoo experience made setting this up in nixos easier.</p>

ivy, and maven. It supports massive multiproject builds and it is easy to override any convention.
It also has a large community for support and it is constantly updated.</p>

<p>Spock is a testing framework built on top of JUnit. It provides an easy way to describe code and
what it is expected to do. Spock is not really about testing units of code and integrating them.
It is all about writing specifications and testing expected features of the code. The perspective
is different but the end result is similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adding spock to a gradle project is easy. Just add the dependency.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In spock it is not easy to separate unit tests from integration tests and run them separately.
There isn&#8217;t really a convention for naming tests as there is in JUnit and it is common to end
test classes with *Spec. When testing with groovy (in JUnit and Spock) it is helpful to use strings
as method names.</p>

<p>When a test method fails the string should try to point out what feature failed. Spock is just one
tool I am using for testing. I also rely on jacoco to ensure I have good test coverage.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jacoco is a great tool for viewing code coverage for tests or anything else running in the jvm. Gradle
 makes using jacoco easy. To use jacoco in gradle apply the plugin.</p>

<p>If you plan on following TDD it is easy to see the coverage as you build tests and add code. It
is not so easy to see what code each individual test is covering. There is some support to view
this in sonar when using jacoco with maven but I haven&#8217;t found support in gradle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a trick to using jacoco with groovy that took me a while to figure out. When groovy is
compiled there are some optimizations added to the resulting bytecode. These optimizations
show up in jacoco as extra instructions that may not be covered in your tests. It is better to
turn off these optimizations when running tests with jacoco. To do this I added the following
to my build.gradle</p>

<div class="listingblock">

<p>Sonarqube is a tool that performs static code analysis. It provides reports on bugs and vulnerabilities
like and has a nice user interface. It also provides a central place to view test reports and
code coverage from jacoco (I could only find info about this for maven). Metrics are rated in
sonarqube which allows the developer to see the health of a project.</p>

<p>There is a script cleanup_diskspace.sh which will remove some files and make the .box file smaller when it is

The script can be called multiple times through <code>vagrant reload --provision</code> and it will only install the jdk once. Oracle&#8217;s jdk has some restrictions. On gentoo the license needs to be accepted and a file needs to be manually downloaded and added to <code>/usr/portage/distfiles</code>. My Vagrantfile adds a share to <code>/usr/portage/distfiles</code> on the guest machine in <code>/distfiles</code>. The shell script will copy the file if it doesn&#8217;t exist, accept the license, and install the package. The only requirement is <code>jdk-8u45-linux-x64.tar.gz</code> needs to be located at '/usr/portage/distfiles'. This can be changed in your own project by editing the share in your Vagrantfile.</p>

<p>Today I am attempting to switch to xdm as my display manager. I currently use LXDE but I am integrating parts of it with the notion windows manager. LXDM is not needed so I would like to replace it with the original xdm.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NVIDIA_Driver_with_Optimus_Laptops">NVIDIA Driver with Optimus Laptops</a> guide has some pointers on how to setup xdm correctly. The driver requres that some xrandr commands are executed on xinit. The instructions are easy to follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that this is complete I am exiting to the console and running the xdm command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that xdm is not loading my .xinitrc file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From my research on how xdm works and gentoo I learned a few things and this is what I did to get things running.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>copy /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc to ~/.xinitrc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make ~/.xinitrc executable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create ~/.xsession</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add export XSESSION=notion to the top of the file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add any other commands you need to execute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add ~/.xinitrc as the final command</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The gentoo X system is setup in such a way that /etc/X11/xinitrc does everything most people want in a xinitrc file. The only problem is the file is not executable. By copying it to my home directory I am able to resuse it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gentoo&#8217;s xinitrc looks for a XSESSION varaible and executes that session. If the session is not found twm is started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the default session to work x11-apps/xsm needs to be installed along with xterm an twm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>xdm only executes a .xsession file in the user&#8217;s home directory using the authenticated user&#8217;s account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this setup I am setting the XSESSION variable to run notion. The /etc/X11/Sessions/notion file points to /usr/bin/notion rather than where I installed it /usr/local/bin/notion.</p>

<p>So far, I think this is one thing I can check of my list for building my system.</p>

  			<a href="blog/2015/05-30-notion-ebuild.html"><h1>notion 9999 ebuild.</h1></a>
  			<p>30 May 2015</p>
  			<p><div class="paragraph">
<p>Today I am investigating installing the latest version of x11-wm/notion on my machine. I got an email from the developer that it should be safe. He said that there are no plans for a new release but many fixes have been made in the commit logs. I&#8217;m going to risk it and try out the latest development source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gentoo has a 9999 ebuild for notion. 9999 ebuilds directly install what is currently being developed in a project&#8217;s source code repository. It takes the current revision of the sources, compiles them, and installs the project on your system. For certain projects this can be dangerous. It depends a lot on the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows">workflow</a> of the project and the policy for commiting broken code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notion seems to use a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow">forking workflow</a> with a main repository located on sourceforge. There are a few repositories on github. My guess is the accepted changes all get put into the sourceforge repo and releases are made from it. With the forking workflow The main repository should not be broken and it should be safe to install software from it without problems. So I am going to install the 9999 package.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is how I unmasked the 9999 ebuild and installed it.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    echo "=x11-wm/notion-9999" &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.unmask
    echo "=x11-wm/notion-9999 **" &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
    emerge -av x11-wm/notion</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This results in an error. Probably because the dependencies have changed since last year. To fix this I am copying the ebuild to my <a href="https://github.com/moaxcp/moaxcp-gentoo-overlay">git overlay</a> and updating it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that there is a problem with the current code. The lua detector is not able to detect the version of lua installed on the system. It uses the name of the lua executable rather than using lua -v to get the version. I will need to wait on installing the 9999 version of notion until this is resolved. The developer said it may not be until next weekend.</p>

unmasked and installed the vagrant command works.</p>

<p>I ran into problems setting up the box. I had google a precise64 box because the default did not download (404 error).
Using the command found <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/basic_usage.html">here</a> I was able to setup a box.</p>

<p>I think vagrant is the way to go for setting these dev boxes up. There is a gentoo box that could be used to setup a

ProtocolBuffer but there is already an updated ebuild for it in the master overlay.</p>

  			<p><div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Heapsort is implemented by creating a heap and continuously removing the root element until the heap is empty. A heap
is a tree with two properties: shape and heap. The shape property requires that the tree is always a complete tree. The
heap property requires the tree to be in min-heap order or max-heap order. A min-heap is a tree where each node is
smaller than it&#8217;s children. A max-heap is a tree where each node is larger than it&#8217;s children. d-ary is used to
describe the maximum number of children a node can have in the heap. Typical heapsort algorithms use a 2-ary heap but
others are possible including a 1-ary heap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the above concepts two choices are made when designing a heapsort. What heap property to use and what d-ary to
use? A configurable heapsort would allow a user to make these decisions instead of being hard coded into the algorithm.
If a user could make those choices what would the heapsort look like? How can the algorithm change between min-heap and
max-heap? How can the algorithm change between 2-ary, 3-ary, 1-ary, or 15-ary? First, lets look at a heap sort.</p>

  			<p>15 October 2014</p>
  			<p><div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two problems with notion&#8217;s keyboard shortcuts: using the Alt key and function key for commands. First the
Alt key is used for things like splitting and resizing frames. The Alt key is usually used to select menus in a window.
For instance, in Netbeans Alt+r selects the run menu. When I push Alt+r notion tries to resize the frame instead of
letting netbeans open the menu. This is why most Tiling windows managers use the Super key (windows key) instead,
allowing applications to use the Alt key. The second problem is, function keys are used for things like creating
workspaces, opening a terminal, and running commands. Notion hijacks these keys so applications cannot use them. The
most recent example I ran into is with alsamixer. Alsamixer uses the function keys for selecting the sound card and
viewing system info. Notion&#8217;s keyboard shortcuts break applications. This is a problem for a mouse free windows
manager. Notion should design a new shortcut layout that is simple and works with other X11 applications.</p>

<p>Connecting to a wpa enabled wireless network can be difficult in the gentoo minimum install cd. Most sources suggest
not to use the cd if this is an issue and to use a cd from a different distribution. There is no reason to do this

network configuration tools for all linux distributions use to connect to wpa networks.</p>
</div>

<p>When using the minimal install cd the network card should be configured to use wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli should be

before they are installed. Gentoo allows each application to be customized at compile time for the users needs before
it is installed through the use of profiles and use flags. Gentoo does this with a program called portage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compiling applications for the computer it is running on ensures the application is completely optimized for the best
possible performance on the computer. Portage allows these optimizations to be set for the compiler so when an
application is installed it is optimized with little input form the user. This series of posts will describe how to
setup gentoo on a Sony VAIO P computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The purpose of this series is to explain how to bring old computers back to life using gentoo. they will explain each
step in updating an old sony viao p with a new gentoo operating system and explain how to get each device on the
computer working. It will also describe the next steps to consider such as power management, using tmux, and links. The
blog posts are not limited to users of a Sony Vaio P computer. They are intended for any user that may wish to bring an
old computer back to life with gentoo.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The series starts with creating a minimal boot cd which is used to install gentoo. The minimal boot cd opens a linux
command line environment for the user to work on the system. Since gentoo does not have an installer it needs to be
installed manually. This involves all of the commands outlined in these posts.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The computer being used for this instruction manual is a Sony Vaio P. There is hardware on this computer that will not
function without the drivers being selected in the kernel.</p>

<p>While I was working on my
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/delta-utilities/">download manager</a> yesterday
I found a bug in java. Every time I tried to make a connection to a
fedora iso file I would get this error:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Does anyone know why this would happen? I found out after looking it up
and finding <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5052093">bug #5052093</a>.
It happened because the api for contentLength uses an int return value,
which has a max of 2,147,483,647. Not only that but when the internal
code parses the contentLength from the stream it has to parseInt in
order to return an int. Since anything above 2,147,483,647 is not an
int a NumberFormatException is thrown. The content-length for the iso
is 3,580,680,192.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fix for this bug is only in JDK7 which can only be downloaded as a
snapshot from java.net. Since they couldn&#8217;t change the original
getContenthLength a new getContethLengthLong method has been added.
From now on I&#8217;m going to use JDK7 even though it&#8217;s not out yet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started a Google Code project for my
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/delta-utilities/">download manager</a>. Here is
the description so far:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This program currently can:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Analyze a connection&#8217;s headers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start, stop, pause a download from a connection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retry a download after a set amount of time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the daily bandwidth used</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Future goals:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download a webpage and all of it&#8217;s sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crawl the internet and access offline</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the first project I&#8217;ve ever made using an outside website to
store everything. I tried to use sourceforge once but I couldn&#8217;t figure
out cvs. Now that netbeans does everything for me It&#8217;s great.</p>

<p>While trying to clean up my computer today I found some programs that I
couldn&#8217;t uninstall. It seems that some installers need a Install.log
file in order to uninstall some programs. Well I looked it up and here
is the procedure I found:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Open the directory where the program is installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move (cut and paste somewhere else) the "install.log" to a different directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, double click the uninstaller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will ask you to open the installation log. Locate to the "install.log" file on your desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, uninstall will work fine and you can uninstall the program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This works great.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parsing Problem: Write a ParserStream that can parse tag attributes and
simple text patterns. The Stream must also be able to replace those
attributes with what the programmer wants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solution: The picture is a diagram of my solution (made with
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia" class="bare">http://live.gnome.org/Dia</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Decorator Pattern: I got the idea to use the decorator pattern from
"Head First Design Patterns". There is a great example of a Java I/O
decorator that converts it&#8217;s input into lower case. This is the basic
pattern that I started with and it grew from there. The main idea is to
replace calls to read() with my own methods. My own methods of read
will parse and replace the attributes. More on that later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Factory Pattern: The next chapter in Head First Design Patterns
discusses the Factory Pattern. I use the Factory Pattern to return the
ParserStream that works with each of the different content types that I
would like to parse (html, jpeg, text). In order to create one of these
Streams the Factory has to have the content type, the input stream for
the content, and the two interfaces for storing the parsed attributes
and replacing the attributes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interface Pattern: I&#8217;m not sure if this is a more specific pattern but
the basic idea is to allow the implementation of storing and
overwriting the parsed attributes to be programmable. The parser
interface is used to store attributes. The information passed to it
will allow the programmer to determine the type of attribute
(src, href) and the original value of the attribute before it is
replaced by the formatting interface. The formattingInterface is used
to change the attributes to whatever the programmer wants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Application: The main reason why I made this is so I can make programs
that download web pages and store them locally and crawl to all the
source files for each link. In order for the html to link properly on
the local computer the src and href attribute values have to be
changed. I&#8217;m not sure if I will need to parse jpeg or text files but
the capability is there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Things to change: The only problem I see with this approach is that if
I want to search for new attributes I will have to rewrite the
ParserStream itself. While this is fine for me to do the class wouldn&#8217;t
not be versatile in a library. One thing I will look into is making the
attribute strings that the parser looks for work like Regular
Expressions. I&#8217;m sure there is a way to do it but for now this will
work.</p>
