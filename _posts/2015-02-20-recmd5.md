<div>I have created a small project focused on the md5 algorithm. I noticed the md5 in java cannot be restarted. If my program is md5ing a large file, I need to start the process over again if the program crashes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To solve this problem I created an MD5State which holds the state of the algorithm. A user can write this state to a file or database as bytes are being processed. If the program crashes the state can be recovered and processing can begin from where it left off.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I originally wrote this on google code ages ago but I wanted try using some of the other internet tools out there. I moved the project over to github and signed up for a travis-ci account. I created a cloud9 project to work on it through a browser. I even created some tests so travis-ci could fail builds if I messed something up.</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>I looked into installing this as a MessageDigest object in the java platform. It looks easy but I'm not sure if it is useful enough.</div>
</div>
<div>The test method is a good example of how to use this project. It takes a byte array and compares the md5 with the md5 from java.</div>
<pre> private boolean testAgainstJavaMD5(byte[] bytes) {
     MessageDigest expected = null;
     MD5MessageDigest test = null;
     try {
         expected = MessageDigest.getInstance("md5");
         test = new MD5MessageDigest();
     } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException ex) {
         Logger.getLogger(MD5MessageDigestTest.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);
         throw new IllegalStateException("could not create MessageDigest", ex);
     }

     expected.update(bytes);
     String s = new BigInteger(1, expected.digest()).toString(16);
     if (s.length() == 31) {
         s = "0" + s;
     }
     test.digest(bytes);
     Logger.getLogger(MD5MessageDigestTest.class.getName()).info(s);
     Logger.getLogger(MD5MessageDigestTest.class.getName()).info(test.getState().toString());
     return s.equals(test.getState().toString());
 }</pre>
