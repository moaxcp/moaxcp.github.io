My webcam doesn't work on my gentoo machine. I actually have a list of hardware that I want to make sure works.

* webcam
* CAC card reader
* hdmi out
* bluetooth
* external dvd burner

The gentoo wiki doesn't seem to have a page for webcams but [arch linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Webcam_setup) does.

Check for messages about the device

        dmesg | less

        typing /usb+enter will highlight the word usb. Type n to go to next match.

        [    9.505824] usb 1-1.5: new high-speed USB device number 4 using ehci-pci
        [    9.787353] usb 1-1.5: New USB device found, idVendor=1bcf, idProduct=280b

        [    9.787358] usb 1-1.5: Manufacturer: CN0CJ3P27248724CBBDJA01

Now we know the device is recognized but it doesn't look like a driver is being loaded. This is indicated by a missing /dev/video0. Devices are assigned by udev. After trying to test using

        udevadm --debug test /sys/class/video4linux/video0

I found that I do not have video4linux. This could mean the kernel does not support video4linux.

running my buildkernel.sh I found that I did not have the kernel setup for webcams.

Device Drivers -->
  <M> Multimedia support  --->
    [*]   Cameras/video grabbers support
    [*]   Media USB Adapters  --->
      <M>   USB Video Class (UVC)
        [*]     UVC input events device support (NEW)

Now that the kernel is compiled with these options I am restarting the system to see what happens.
...
The camera works in Cheese!
