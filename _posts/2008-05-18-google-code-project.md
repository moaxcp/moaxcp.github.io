I've started a Google Code project for my [download manager](http://code.google.com/p/delta-utilities/). Here is the description so far:

This program currently can:
* Analyze a connection's headers
* Start, stop, pause a download from a connection
* Retry a download after a set amount of time
* Limit the daily bandwidth used

Future goals:
* Download a webpage and all of it's sources
* Crawl the internet and access offline

This is the first project I've ever made using an outside website to store everything. I tried to use sourceforge once but I couldn't figure out cvs. Now that netbeans does everything for me It's great.
