title: Release of Vagrant Box
layout: post

I just released a working version of my gentoo64 vagrant box. Setting it up is not as easy as vagrant makes it out to be. The issues are documented on the box page though. Please take a look at [my gentoo vagrant box](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/moaxcp/boxes/gentoo64).

Uses

* provision with java and now you can test your spring-boot applications.
* add your gentoo overlay and test your packages on a vm.
