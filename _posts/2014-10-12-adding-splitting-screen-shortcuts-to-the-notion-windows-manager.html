<p>Some time ago I asked a question on stack overflow about adding new commands to the notion window manager. These commands split the entire workspace, adding a new frame to the bottom or side of it. Here is a link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24494725/splitting-workspaces-in-the-notion-window-manager</p>
<p>In cfg_tiling.lua add<br />
<blockquote>kpress(META.."Z", "WTiling.split_top(_, 'bottom'):goto_focus()"),</p></blockquote>
<p> inside the "defbindings("WTiling", {" block and add<br />
<blockquote>kpress("Z", "Wtiling.split_top(_, 'left'):goto_focus()"),</p></blockquote>
<p> inside the "submap(META.."K", {" block</p>
<p>It sets up META..Z and META..K + Z as the key bindings for these actions.</p>
<p>After setting these up on my Dell precision 4600 only META..Z seems to work and the focus is not moving to the new frame.</p>
