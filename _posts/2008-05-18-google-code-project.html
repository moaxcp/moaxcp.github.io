<p>I've started a Google Code project for my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/delta-utilities/">download manager</a>. Here is the description so far:<br />This program currently can:<br />Analyze a connection's headers<br />Start, stop, pause a download from a connection<br />Retry a download after a set amount of time<br />Limit the daily bandwidth used<br />Future goals:<br />Download a webpage and all of it's sources<br />Crawl the internet and access offline<br />This is the first project I've ever made using an outside website to store everything. I tried to use sourceforge once but I couldn't figure out cvs. Now that netbeans does everything for me It's great.</p>
