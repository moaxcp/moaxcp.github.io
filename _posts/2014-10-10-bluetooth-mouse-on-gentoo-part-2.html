<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">simple-agent is no longer available in bluez. The gentoo wiki must be very outdated. The version I am using is 5.21. The test-programs use flag is no longer used. So I removed it from package.use. After searching for commands that start with blue I found bluetoothctl which did everything I needed. Here is what I did once bluetoothctl opened.
<dl>
<dt>1. list</dt>
<dd>displays the local controllers on the computer.</dd>
<dt>2. devices</dt>
<dd>displays the devices.</dd>
<dt>3. scan on</dt>
<dd>starts scanning for new devices to add. (put the device in pairing mode).</dd>
<dt>4. pair {mac address}</dt>
<dd>pairs the device with the controller.</dd>
</dl>
<p>from here I thought the mouse would work well but the mouse was still flashing for pairing. The help menu has a connect command in it so I tried that.</p>
<p>5. connect {mac address}</p>
<p>Now the mouse is working. I also have a bluetooth remote keyboard that I could add in the future. In the past I had to enter keys on it to pair. It will be interesting to see how bluetoothctl handles this. </p></div>
