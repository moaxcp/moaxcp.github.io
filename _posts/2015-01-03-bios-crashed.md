After trying to delete a UEFI entry in my system bios my computer no longer starts up. It gets to the BIOS screen, the progress bar fills in, and they system doesn't start. Any attempt to get into the BIOS menu does not work. The screen says it is preparing the menu but it never opens. I have tried resetting the bios by unplugging it, taking out the battery, taking out the motherboard battery, and pressing the power button to remove any static power. The result is the same. It looks like I now need to replace the motherboard.

I have started working on my tiny sony vaio p. gentoo will not update from a problem with sys-devel/llvm-3.5.0. It has already been reported in the forum [here](http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7676898.html).

Meetup.com looks like fun. I have signed up for the NOVALUG group. I'm not sure where will happen but I'm excited about it.

I found a site https://projecteuler.net/. It is a sight for solving math problems using computer programs. This would be fun to practice with clojure or the new java features if I can get my computer setup.
