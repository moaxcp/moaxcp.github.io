title: adding posts to a github blog
layout: post
---
I just had this great idea to use github.com's editor for creating posts in this blog. Here is how it works.

1. go to the repo moaxcp.github.io/_posts and click on the + to add a file
2. create a file name and fill in the post
3. commit to new branch for drafts or master if the post is good
4. accept the pull request to publish the draft

I've been using vi and git on my laptop to write posts but I would much rather just use my broswer. The problem with the github editor is no spell checking but I have the same problem with my current vi setup. 

I'm sure this is known to many github users but it has taken me a while to put this idea together.

This is the first post I am doing this with so lets see how it goes.
