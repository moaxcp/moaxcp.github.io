title: adding posts to a github blog
layout: posts
---
I just had this great idea of using github.com to create posts in this blog for me. Here is how it works.

1. go to the repo moaxcp.github.io/_posts and click on the + to add a file
2. create a file name and fill in the post
3. commit to new branch for drafts or master if the post is good
4. submit a pull request to publish the draft

I've been using vi and git on my laptop to write posts but I would much rather just use my broswer. The problem with the github editor is no spell checking but I have the same problem with my current vi setup. This is the first post I am doing this with so lets see how it goes.
