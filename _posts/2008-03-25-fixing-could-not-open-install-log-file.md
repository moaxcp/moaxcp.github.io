While trying to clean up my computer today I found some programs that I couldn't uninstall. It seems that some installers need a Install.log file in order to uninstall some programs. Well I looked it up and here is the procedure I found:

1. Open the directory where the program is installed.

2. Move (cut and paste somewhere else) the "install.log" to a different directory.

3. Now, double click the uninstaller

4. It will ask you to open the installation log. Locate to the "install.log" file on your desktop.

5. Now, uninstall will work fine and you can uninstall the program.

This works great.
